"""Tensor-contraction-based CPT computation for Gaia IR strategies.

Replaces O(2^k × BP) brute-force folding in ``fold_composite_to_cpt`` and
``compute_coarse_cpts`` with exact variable elimination.

Design:
    - ``factor_to_tensor``: Factor → dense ndarray + axis labels
    - ``contract_to_cpt``: einsum-based variable elimination with unary priors
    - ``strategy_cpt``: recursive layer-by-layer CPT for a Strategy, cached by
      strategy_id per call

Every non-free variable's unary prior is applied exactly once, at the layer
where it is marginalized.  This matches the semantics of BP on the current
factor graph and of ``gaia.bp.exact.exact_inference``.
